# frente_registro

This repository is intended to store all the write-ups of the entity. Here, you will find various solved CTFs from different platforms, with each CTF potentially having multiple versions..

## Structure 🧱

The directory structure is as follows:

```bash
├── <CTF platform>
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── <CTF>
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── <CTF version>
│   │   │   ├── writeup.docx
```

Each platform will have a directory named after it, containing a README.md file with a brief description of the platform and the solved CTFs. Inside the CTF directory, there will be a README.md file with a brief description of the CTF and the write-ups for each version of the CTF. Each version directory will be named after the user responsible for the write-up.

1. Clone the repository;
2. Create a branch with the following pattern: `<platform lowercase>_<ctf name lowercase>_<github user>`;
